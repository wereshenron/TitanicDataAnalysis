# TitanicDataAnalysis
A small school project conducting data analysis of the Titanic shipwreck.

However not required, JupyterLab software was used to write this code and often annotated with markups to clean the data up. 

I recommend using a JupyterLab client to run the .ipynb files for easier readability!
